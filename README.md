# Overview

A JavaScript-based toolkit for web security testing and browser exploration. Deployable as a bookmarklet or via console, it offers pen-testing tools, vulnerability assessments, and productivity features. The script creates a user-friendly UI overlay for easy access to its functions. Originally designed to test vulnerabilities of school device monitoring software like Securly.

As of June 2025, it's been 3 years since I wrote this project, so keep in mind that this was the work of a hs freshman.
