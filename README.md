# Mortal Hub

Pure JS script, usable by either running as a bookmarklet or running in your browser console, which contains certain pen-testing tools, as well as fun addons. The script creates an easy to use UI overlay on your browser tab.

## Requirements

- Any device with a browser
- The ability to either run bookmarklets, code from the url bar, or the dev console.


## Using the script

To run the script as a bookmarklet, naviagate to https://craexz.github.io/mortal-hub/ and follow the instructions

If you want to copy its code to run in the url bar/dev console (manually), just right click the button on the webpage, then click copy link address.

I will not provide further instructions to run the code manually, but you may find them easily on the internet (youtube, google, etc.)
